Gift Cards Challenge
====================

It's a small app. The goal is to create a page which allows the user to register gift cards. A gift card is basically one person that gives a gift to someone else.

## Problem description

A gift card should contain the name of the sender (string), the receiver (string), a description (string) and an amount of money (decimal).
<br>
The report should be a table with tree columns:
* The name of the sender;
* How many times some person has given a gift;
* The amount of money that person has sent to someone;

### Instructions
* You should publish the code in Github and push it according your progress.
* Mandatory: write unit tests JUST where you think is convenient.
* Optional: Acceptance test will be extra points.
* Layout will **not** be evaluated. No CSS, no JS is needed.
* No validations is needed.
* Don't forget to send me your repository link once you start.

You are free to choose the tools (GEMs) you prefer.
<br>
There is no final date for you delivery your solution, although every sooner push in GIthub will be strongly considered.
